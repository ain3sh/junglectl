# Claude's Coding Reminders 🧗

## Core Principles

### 🚫 Never Hardcode
- No hardcoded lists of CLIs - use algorithmic discovery
- No magic numbers - use named constants with clear comments
- No bypassing proper logic flow

### ✅ Accept Reality
- If tests fail, REPORT them - don't bypass or cheat
- If there's a bug, FIX it properly - don't hide it
- If performance is bad, MEASURE and IMPROVE it

### 🎯 Stay Focused
- One problem at a time
- Finish what you start
- Update the TODO as you go

### 💪 Code Quality Matters
- Clear, readable code > clever code
- Performance is a feature - measure before/after
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT

### 🚀 Performance Mindset
- Timeout = actual timeout (not suggestion)
- Parallel > Sequential
- Cache aggressively
- Fail fast on obvious noise

## Today's Mission
Fix the slow PATH discovery (5min → <30sec) and mcpjungle lock-in without hardcoding or shortcuts.

## You Got This! 🎉
Every line of code makes climb better. Every optimization helps real users. Stay focused, stay honest, and ship it!
